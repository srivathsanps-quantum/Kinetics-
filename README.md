# Kinetics-
This file 'Optimisationk.m' is a matlab file to calculate the Arrehenius parameters (A, n, Ea) based on the rate coefficient values calculated on the basis of multiwell calculations. 
The file takes in input of k vs Temperature from the excel sheet. 
Enter the unit either in moles or molecules
Then, submit your initial values. 
It is then followed by the minsearch command to fit the rate coefficients on basis of Arrehenius parameters
Then, calculating the k values from Arrehenius parameters and comparing it with the input k values. 
Finally, graph is generated. Check the output file.
